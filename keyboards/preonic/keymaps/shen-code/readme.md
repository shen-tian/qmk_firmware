# The `shen-code` layout - largely based on the Preonic default

Stated goal:

 - Use in macOS, with emacs as the main code editor.
 
 Philosophy:
 
 - Don't get too weird. Don't want to struggle too much to change between this and a normal keyboard. Thus, use QWERTY, and keep as much relative positioning as possible. 

Changes so far:

 - Added right shift opposite left shift. 
 - Moved Enter to bottom right corner, use via palming
 - Changed the bottom left key to "Eject", so the Control Shift Eject "lock" combo works. Probably not what I want to leave it on
 - Moved the Right arrow to just below the backspace, mainly because that key is underused by default (delete).
 - Space Cadet shift/brackets
 - Cleaned up most of the `Lower` layer. Using the WSAD keys for cursor.
 - Removed the `DVORAK` and `COLEMK` layers.
 - Make the `Lower` layer contain `-=[]\`
 
 Current thinking is to get the NB keys where they need to be, then start moving the less important ones into position.
